# t3w1 introduction to JS

# Saturday
- Object review
- Functions vs Methods
- Characteristics of Functions:
    - First-Class Function:
        - Assigned to variables
        - Passed as argument to other functions (callbacks)
        - returned from functions
    - return (obvious one)
    - Hoisting (Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can call a function before it's declared)
    - Scope (Global and Local)
- Review of the topics covered so far

- JSDocs
